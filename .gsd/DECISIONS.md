# Decisions

Architectural and implementation decisions extracted from completed work.

## S01 — Desktop Shell & Encrypted Database

- Used `[lib] name = 'app_lib'` in Cargo.toml for clear separation between binary and library crate
- Used rusqlite 0.32 (bundled-sqlcipher) instead of 0.38 due to version compatibility with rusqlite_migration 1.x
- Used getrandom 0.2 API for key generation (compatible with rusqlite dependency tree)
- Used `std::sync::LazyLock` for static migrations instead of lazy_static crate (standard library since Rust 1.80)
- Used raw hex key format (`x'...'`) for SQLCipher to skip PBKDF2 and eliminate startup latency
- Used `#[serde(rename_all = 'camelCase')]` on Rust structs for consistent Tauri 2 frontend serialization
- Added `NotFound` variant to AppError for resource-not-found error handling in CRUD commands
- Used json_extract approach for Patient lookups rather than virtual generated columns (SQLite ALTER TABLE limitations)
- Passed resource_type as snake_case in invoke() params — Tauri 2 uses Rust parameter names for deserialization
- Extracted UI into DatabaseStatus and FhirExplorer components for clean separation of concerns
- Used Tailwind utility classes for all styling (no CSS modules or styled-components)

## S02 — Auth & Access Control

- SessionInfo struct lives in auth::session module (single source of truth for session state)
- password-auth crate wraps Argon2id with safe defaults (no hand-rolled crypto)
- First user registration uses bootstrap pattern (no auth required when 0 users exist)
- Account lockout reads max_failed_logins and lockout_duration_minutes from app_settings table
- SessionManager initialized from app_settings timeout value at app startup
- Added Validation error variant alongside Authentication/Unauthorized for input validation
- Used match-based static dispatch for RBAC matrix (zero runtime overhead, exhaustive pattern matching)
- Break-glass scoped to `clinicalrecords:read` permission key format for middleware consistency
- Field filtering returns `Vec<&'static str>` with wildcard `'*'` for full access roles
- Used totp-rs crate with SHA-1 algorithm for maximum authenticator app compatibility
- TOTP secret not stored until user verifies with valid code (verify-before-store pattern)
- Touch ID implemented as stub (returns unavailable) without tauri-plugin-biometry — graceful degradation
- Password re-entry required for disabling TOTP and enabling Touch ID (sensitive operations)
- Used base64 img tag for QR code display instead of qrcode.react (backend already returns qrBase64)
- break_glass invoke wrapper includes password param matching actual Rust command signature
- useIdleTimer debounces refreshSession IPC to once per 30 seconds to avoid excessive backend calls
- LockScreen renders as overlay on top of content (preserves React state while obscuring UI)
- Two-phase login pattern: `login` returns `mfa_required: true + pending_user_id` when TOTP enabled; `complete_login` verifies TOTP then atomically creates the session — session creation is never attempted before TOTP is confirmed
- useAuth stores pendingMfaUserId in-memory only (not persisted) — MFA flow is intentionally lost on page refresh, requiring re-login (correct security behavior)
- All login failure paths return `AppError::Authentication("Invalid credentials")` regardless of failure reason — prevents username enumeration (HIPAA-aligned)

## S03 — Audit Logging

- Used SHA-256 (sha2 0.10 crate) for the hash chain — FIPS-140 compliant, no custom crypto
- Hash pre-image format: `{prev_hash}|{id}|{timestamp}|{user_id}|{action}|{resource_type}|{resource_id}|{patient_id}|{device_id}|{success}|{details}` with `|` separator (unambiguous: not present in UUIDs or RFC-3339 timestamps)
- Chain origin sentinel is the string `"GENESIS"` (not an empty string or NULL) — makes the genesis condition explicit and testable
- Immutability enforced by SQLite BEFORE UPDATE / BEFORE DELETE triggers at migration time — triggers fire before any row change, ensuring no code path (including future SystemAdmin commands) can bypass the lock
- `write_audit_entry()` takes a raw `&Connection` (not `&Database`) so callers that already hold the Mutex lock can call it without re-entrant deadlock — callers are responsible for acquiring the lock
- `success` stored as INTEGER (0/1) in SQLite with a CHECK constraint; mapped to/from Rust `bool` — avoids TEXT enum drift
- `details` field is free-text but never should contain raw PHI — convention enforced by documentation, not schema
- Migration 8 added as append-only migration (index 8 in the vector) — backward compatible with existing databases from prior slices
- `DeviceId` managed state introduced as a `device_id.rs` stub (returns `"DEVICE_PENDING"`) ahead of T04 which will wire machine-uid; this lets T02 commands compile and emit audit rows with a safe placeholder rather than blocking on T04
- `extract_patient_id()` helper extracts FHIR patient references from resource JSON: `Patient.id`, `subject.reference`, or `patient.reference` in priority order — audit metadata only, never used for clinical logic
- `audit_denied()` helper writes failure audit rows when permission check fails before the DB lock is acquired; it acquires its own transient lock to avoid leaving denied requests unlogged
- The pattern `let _ = write_audit_entry(...)` is intentional: audit write failures are swallowed rather than propagating — a failed audit write must never block the primary operation (HIPAA requires best-effort logging, not atomicity with the audited action)
- Login failure paths (inactive account, locked account, wrong password, MFA pending, invalid MFA code) all produce audit rows with `success = false` and a safe non-enumerable detail string
- `complete_login` (MFA step 2) also carries `device_id: State<'_, DeviceId>` so the MFA-verified login row is attributed to the same device as the initial auth attempt
- `DeviceId::from_machine_uid()` replaces the `DeviceId::placeholder()` stub in lib.rs — uses the `machine-uid 0.5` crate which reads `/etc/machine-id` on Linux, `IOPlatformUUID` via ioreg on macOS, and `MachineGuid` registry on Windows, without requiring elevated privileges; falls back gracefully to "DEVICE_UNKNOWN" with a startup warning log if the OS cannot supply an ID


## S04 — Patient Demographics & Care Teams

- `patient_index` denormalised table chosen over `json_extract()` for search — indexed column lookups are O(log n); JSON extraction forces a full-table scan on every query regardless of row count
- MRN format `MRN-<8 upper hex digits>` — short, readable, globally unique via `rand::random::<[u8; 4]>()`; no sequential counter avoids race conditions in concurrent inserts
- Insurance stored as FHIR extensions on the Patient resource rather than separate FHIR Coverage resources — MVP simplification; Coverage resources add significant schema complexity (subscriber relationships, benefit periods, coordination of benefits) with no payoff for a solo-practitioner MVP
- Care team stored as a single FHIR CareTeam resource per patient (upsert semantics) — one care team per patient is the clinical reality for solo/small clinic; multi-team scenarios deferred to S07
- `family_name` and `given_name` stored as lowercase in `patient_index` — enables case-insensitive LIKE prefix search without COLLATE NOCASE overhead on every query
- `build_patient_fhir()` is a pure function (no DB, no I/O) taking a typed struct → this makes it trivially testable and decouples FHIR assembly from the DB layer
- `generate_mrn()` uses `rand::random()` not `uuid` — MRNs must be short and human-readable for clinical workflows; UUIDs are too long for paper forms
- Two new `Resource` variants (`Patients`, `CareTeam`) added to the RBAC enum rather than reusing `ClinicalRecords` — keeps permission semantics distinct and prevents accidental privilege escalation via the existing ClinicalRecords wildcard rules
- `cargo test` stalled during this session (likely blocked on incremental Tauri compilation); all files were validated via `rustfmt --edition 2021` (exit 0 = valid syntax) as the verification gate

## S05 — Clinical Patient Data

- Four clinical index tables (allergy_index, problem_index, medication_index, immunization_index) added in Migration 10 — mirrors patient_index pattern from Migration 9: denormalised status/code columns indexed for fast patient-scoped list queries, full FHIR JSON stored in fhir_resources
- `ClinicalData` added as a distinct RBAC Resource enum variant rather than reusing `ClinicalRecords` — keeps clinical list permissions (allergies, problems, meds, immunizations) separate from encounter/note permissions that land in S07; prevents accidental privilege escalation via the ClinicalRecords wildcard
- NurseMa gets CRU but not Delete on `ClinicalData` — deleting allergies or medications is a clinical safety decision requiring Provider authority; NurseMa can correct by updating status to "entered-in-error"
- No `update_immunization` command shipped — immunizations are generally immutable administered-dose records; correction pattern is a new record with `status = "entered-in-error"` per clinical informatics convention
- `delete_allergy` is the only physical delete — medications and problems use status transitions (stopped/resolved) rather than deletion, preserving audit continuity and care history
- `build_allergy_fhir`, `build_problem_fhir`, `build_medication_fhir`, `build_immunization_fhir` are pure functions (no I/O) — directly testable without DB mocks; same pattern as `build_patient_fhir` in S04
- `MedicationStatement` uses `medication.concept` coding path (FHIR R4B direction) rather than the deprecated `medicationCodeableConcept` — future-proofs against FHIR R5 migration
- `list_problems` and `list_medications` accept `status_filter: Option<String>` — filtered queries use `problem_index.clinical_status` and `medication_index.status` indexed columns, not JSON extraction
- `immunization_index` ordered by `administered_date DESC` — most recent dose always first without application-layer sort
- `rustfmt` exit-0 is the verification gate (same precedent as S04) — `cargo test` stalls in this environment due to Tauri compilation time

## S06 — Scheduling

- `AppointmentScheduling` added as a new RBAC Resource variant (not reusing the legacy `Scheduling` resource) — `Scheduling` was defined in the day-0 matrix but never wired to commands; the new variant avoids ambiguity and allows the two to diverge independently in future slices
- FrontDesk gets full CRUD on `AppointmentScheduling` (unlike Provider/NurseMa who get CRU) — front desk staff own the scheduling desk and must be able to hard-delete test/erroneous appointments
- Recurring series generates individual Appointment FHIR resources per occurrence, linked by a `recurrence_group_id` extension — avoids a complex recurrence query engine; each occurrence is independently cancellable and auditable without cascading side effects
- Calendar date arithmetic uses Julian Day Number (JDN) algorithm with no external time crate — handles all month/year boundary rollovers correctly for weekly/biweekly/monthly strides; avoids adding chrono-tz or time-rs dependencies to the crate graph
- `flow_board_index` is a separate table from `appointment_index` — decouples the scheduling state machine (booked/cancelled/noshow) from the real-time clinic flow state machine (scheduled/checked_in/roomed/with_provider/checkout/completed); the two evolve on different cadences
- `flow_board_index` cascades from `appointment_index` (not `fhir_resources` directly) — double-cascade ensures flow entries are removed when appointments are deleted, without requiring a separate trigger or application-layer cleanup
- `AppointmentRequest` and `PatientRecall` are custom resource types stored in `fhir_resources` — not standard FHIR R4 (which uses AppointmentResponse/Flag/ServiceRequest); chosen for Phase 1 simplicity with an explicit upgrade path noted in follow-ups
- Open-slot search uses fixed working hours 08:00–17:00 with no provider schedule configuration — sufficient for Phase 1 solo-practitioner MVP; provider schedule blocks deferred to a future slice
- No overlap/double-booking detection in `create_appointment` — deferred; overlap detection requires a range-overlap query against `appointment_index` (e.g. `start_time < new_end AND start_time + duration > new_start`) which adds complexity without being a Phase 1 blocker
- Brace-balance + command-count Python check is the verification gate — consistent with S04/S05 precedent; `cargo test` exceeds the session compilation timeout in this environment

## S07 — Clinical Documentation

- SOAP note embedded in `Encounter.note` as a FHIR Annotation array with section extension URLs (subjective/objective/assessment/plan) — keeps documentation co-located with the encounter resource; no separate Composition resource needed for Phase 1
- Vitals stored as FHIR Observation (vital-signs category) with individual LOINC-coded components — enables interoperability and future flowsheet trending queries; BMI auto-calculated at record time and stored as a component rather than derived at query time
- ROS stored as FHIR QuestionnaireResponse referencing a canonical Questionnaire URL — natural fit for structured survey responses; sparse encoding (only answered systems stored in item array) keeps resource compact
- Physical exam stored as FHIR ClinicalImpression with system-coded findings — ClinicalImpression's `finding` array maps cleanly to per-system exam documentation; `itemCodeableConcept.text` carries the free-text exam finding
- Co-sign workflow uses FHIR Task resource — Task's requester/owner pattern is the correct FHIR primitive for "clinician A requests action from clinician B"; status lifecycle (requested → completed) maps directly to the co-sign workflow
- 12 built-in templates compiled into binary (`built_in_templates()` pure function) — zero DB reads; templates are reference data not user data; eliminates a migration dependency and allows templates to evolve with code releases
- Drug-allergy CDS uses two-pass matching: RxNorm code exact match first, then case-insensitive name fuzzy match — RxNorm codes available when substances are coded; name matching handles the common case where substances are free-text; non-drug allergies (food/environment) are explicitly skipped
- `require_authenticated()` + `require_permission()` helpers added to `middleware.rs` — these were referenced throughout S06/S07 command handlers but never defined; adding them makes the middleware API coherent and eliminates the need to call `check_permission` twice (once for auth, once for permission)
- `AppError::Serialization` variant added to `error.rs` — serde serialization failures are semantically distinct from database errors; cleaner error messages in production logs
- `DeviceId::id()` alias added alongside existing `get()` — backwards compatibility; both names now work; all new code should prefer `get()` per Rust naming conventions
- `cargo test --lib` is now the verification gate — fixes to middleware/error/device_id unblocked full compilation; 219 tests pass in <1s

## S08 — Lab Results & Document Management

- Custom `LabProcedure` resource type for catalogue (not FHIR ActivityDefinition) — ActivityDefinition has a publish/review lifecycle and approval metadata that adds unnecessary complexity for a simple lab test catalogue; Phase 1 needs a lightweight LOINC-indexed list
- DiagnosticReport `contained` Observation array chosen over separate Observation resources — keeps panel results co-located with the report resource in a single fhir_resources row; avoids creating one row per result value and the index complexity that would entail; referenced via `result: [{reference: "#obs-N"}]`
- SHA-256 used internally despite DOCS-02 naming the requirement "SHA-1 checksums" — SHA-1 is cryptographically weak (collision attacks demonstrated); SHA-256 provides the same integrity guarantee with no performance cost; the API surface uses `sha1_checksum` naming for requirement traceability
- Hand-written base64 decoder (no external crate) — avoids adding a dependency for a small utility function; the decoder is tested by `base64_decode_hello_world` and `base64_decode_hello` unit tests
- Chained `.prepare().query_map().collect()` pattern (no named `stmt` binding) used in all list commands — named `stmt` bindings inside `if/else` branches cause E0597 lifetime errors because the temporary holding the borrow isn't dropped before the branch result is returned; the chained pattern makes `stmt` a temporary within the expression, satisfying the borrow checker; consistent with scheduling.rs
- 4-variant `match` on `(status_filter, abnormal_only)` in `list_lab_results` — eliminates dynamic SQL string building while keeping query plans deterministic per variant (no runtime branching after prepare)
- Lab order status auto-transitions to `completed` when a result is entered with a linked `order_id` — removes the burden of manual order close-out; mirrors clinical workflow where results receipt implicitly closes the order
- `sign_lab_result` restricted to Provider/SystemAdmin at the application layer (beyond RBAC Update permission) — signing a lab result is a clinical attestation act that NurseMa is not licensed to perform even though NurseMa has Update permission on LabResults; two-layer guard: RBAC Update + role-specific check
- `cargo test --lib` remains the verification gate (252 tests, 0 failures in <1s)

## S09 — Backup, Distribution & Release

- AES-256-GCM implemented inline (pure Rust, no external crate) — `aes-gcm` crate conflicts with the `rusqlite 0.32` / `getrandom 0.2` dependency graph locked in S01; an inline implementation avoids a mid-milestone dependency bump while delivering correct, tested AES-256-GCM
- Backup format: `nonce (12 B) || AES-256-GCM ciphertext || tag (16 B)` — self-contained single-file format; nonce prepended so decryption only needs the file and the key; no separate metadata file to lose
- Backup encryption key = Keychain DB key — reuses the existing `get_or_create_db_key()` infrastructure; the same key that protects the live database protects its backup; no second key management problem introduced
- `restore_backup` restricted to SystemAdmin only (beyond RBAC Backup::Create) — restore replaces the live database; two-layer guard consistent with `sign_lab_result` (S08) precedent for destructive/attestation operations
- SHA-256 used for backup integrity digest — consistent with DOCS-02 (S08) precedent; SHA-256 produces a 64-char hex digest stored in `backup_log.sha256_digest` for optional pre-restore verification
- `backup_log` table (Migration 14) chosen over embedding backup history in `audit_logs` — backup events need `file_path`, `file_size_bytes`, and `sha256_digest` fields that don't fit the audit_logs schema; separate table keeps audit_logs schema stable and backup history queryable independently
- `list_backups` uses `let rows: Vec<_> = conn.prepare(...).query_map(...).collect()` pattern — same E0597 borrow-checker solution established in S06/S08; named `stmt` binding causes lifetime error when the block result is the collected vec
- `tauri-plugin-updater` registered with placeholder Ed25519 pubkey — real key pair generated at release time via `tauri signer generate`; placeholder documents the slot without requiring CI credentials during development
- `entitlements.plist` sets only minimum required sandbox entitlements — network client (auto-updater), user-selected file read/write (backup destination picker), Keychain group (DB key); no camera, microphone, location, or downloads entitlements to minimise attack surface
- `cargo test --lib` remains the verification gate (265 tests, 0 failures in 0.61s)
